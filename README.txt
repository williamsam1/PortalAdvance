Use any standard Game Boy Advance emulator to play using the PortalAdvance.gba file. Manually build the .gba file using VBAM with "make vba".

You are an Aperture Weighted Companion Cube that is being used to test the Aperture Handheld Portal Device after all of the human test subjects have died. Complete the test chambers to help create a neat gun for the people who are still alive, and possibly be rewarded with cake.

Use the directional buttons to move.

Once the Handheld Portal Device has been acquired, press A (Z on VBAM) to fire a portal in the direction of the selected directional buttons.

Press Start (Enter on VBAM) to return to the title screen at any point.
